# get_next_line

The function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.

# What is get_next_line?

get_next_line is an individual project at 42 that basically reads a file line by line.
I could only use those three standard library functions:
read
malloc
free
So it makes the project harder. But I could also use functions from my personal library.
